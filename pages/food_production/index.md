title: Food Production
---

Understanding how, how much, where, and which types of food are grown within a region can help increase the supply of and demand for local food and identify adjustments that can be made to farming practices. There are many prerequisites for food production, from knowledge of how to raise crops and livestock, to access to land, to favorable environmental conditions (sun, soil, water), to agricultural inputs (seeds, livestock, soil amendments, tools, farm equipment, labor). Land development, population growth, climate change, and consumer preferences also shape the production landscape. The dashboards below outline information about the current supply of local agricultural products, local production acreage, the agricultural workforce, and how climate change affects food production.

Much of the publicly available data on food production stems from a single source: the United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA NASS) Census of Agriculture. Each Census, conducted every five years, is a nationwide survey designed to gather robust information about all farms and ranches and the people who operate them. This data can be helpful for producers, consumers, and researchers for planning purposes and identifying trends.

However, there are limitations to this data. Though responding to the Census is required by federal law, the response rate declined to roughly 61% in the 2022 Census. While this still represents a large sample size, it is unclear who is not counted. Those who respond potentially have more time, financial resources, social connections, and access to technology. Institutionalized discriminatory practices at the USDA—such as denying access to forms of assistance like low-interest loans and grants to Black farmers and other farmers of color and that led to financial losses and loss of land throughout the 1900s—have eroded trust among historically marginalized producers. This mistrust makes it less likely that they will participate in data collection efforts like the Census. These factors lead to sampling issues that likely result in underrepresentation of small- and mid-sized producers, producers of color, and producers with limited access to technology.

Another limitation of the Census of Agriculture is that data collection happens only once every five years. There is opportunity to collect more localized data on a more frequent basis to be able to make plans around food production more equitably and nimbly.

When viewing any of the dashboards below, note that certain data points may be missing for a given county. This is because the Census avoids disclosing data that would identify an individual farm, for example, if there is only one producer of a certain crop within a county.


## Questions to Consider

- How many farms are there in Central Texas? What is their size breakdown?
- What is currently grown in Central Texas, and how is this influenced by environment and culture?
- How does local food production in Central Texas compare to consumer demand?
- Where is there opportunity to import less food that can be grown locally?
- Where are areas with underutilized arable farmland?
- Given land use competition, development pressures, and jurisdictional issues, how can Central Texas work at a regional level to preserve agricultural land?
- Where is there availability of city- or county-owned land to support community-driven or publicly owned food production?
- How representative of the general population are the farmers in Central Texas in terms of race and ethnicity, gender, and age?
- What is the environmental impact of local food production? How do different farming techniques and practices affect the surrounding environment?
- What would strengthen local food producers’ resilience and reduce crop loss in the face of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters?
